# Various Visualizations of Data PHP

In this project we created database and some table in the database, then some dummy data added to the database. These data represented in various ways such as barchart and piechart.


## Task

- Create a MySQL database on phpMyAdmin and add a few tables with dummy data.

- Assume that every 30 seconds, new data will be added to the database.

- Visualize the data using various gauges, charts and graphs using PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

- Ensure that the graphs always fetch the latest data with timestamps.

- Make the dashboard responsive.
## Roadmap

- Creating Database called Project-1

- Creating 2 relations

- Adding Experimental Data

- Desinging the Dashboard

- Connencting Database

- Loading Data dynamically from the Database

- Showing it in Barchart

- Showing it in Piechart(with timestamp)


## Lessons Learned

- How to create a new database
- How to create new table to the database.
- How to insert data to the database
- How to connect database in PHP
- How manipulate those data
- How can we use timestamp to make things more specific and Updated
